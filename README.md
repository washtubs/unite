# unite
directory synchronization framework (uses unison as backend)

implemented in python

# TODO

Make an easy way to test. We will need to check lots of mocked up examples and be able to change environments quickly
* describe the basic namespace of a unite directory, plus all relevant environment vars in a single src file. 
* unit tests should be environment aware

Flesh out high level state machine

Internalize .description directory as an object Description 
* mock up a sample .description directory
* ~~determine whether multiple inheritance will be a problem~~
    Will not be a problem as long as:
    1. no two predicates contradict.
    2. any set of predicates in any order canonicalizes to the same description.
* import .description directory to singleton Description object
* Description can have a SHA to use as a fingerprint
* resolve predicates in order (stable) for a given file path

Experiment with tracking .description and .canon in a git repo

Function that takes a relpath (from UNITE_ROOT) or full path, and retrieves.
the local file, the global file, or the description.

filesystem monitor daemon. Watch for important events like 
* when descriptions are modified
* when a local file is modified
* grounding for event manager

filename utils
* canonicalize extensions: i.e. encrypt[key2].diff.canon[sortu].encrypt[key1] --> encrypt[key1].encrypt[key2].canon[sortu].diff

Encrypt file using key

config file reader

validate state:
* every file AND directory in local has a twin in mirror directories: global and description
* no file in local is a symlink
* check for contradictory predicates **(right now, this does not exist)**
* trim extraneous files in description directory (not critical)

resolve predicates to actions.
* encrypt[key1] should find key1 on the local machine and encrypt or decrypt depending on the direction.
* encrypt[scramble] should find a custom algorithm on the local machine and run it
* canon[sortu] should find the corresponding canon script and run it

# Questions

Description modification: what to do about conflicts, since these folders will be tracked globally?
shouldnâ€™t happen very often. Lets aim for resolving these issues automatically in the future, but for the time being, it should not happen too often.

# Notes

prior to any global interaction, we will want to ensure that the .description dir is identical. To do this, we will make 
a SHA fingerprint a part of the Description object and use that prior to any and all global exchanges, to ensure they are consistent.
